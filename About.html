                    Evanescence is an American rock band founded in Little Rock, Arkansas, in 1995 by singer and
                    pianist Amy Lee and guitarist Ben Moody. After recording independent albums, the band released their first 
                    full-length album, Fallen, on Wind-up Records in 2003. Fallen sold more than 17 million copies worldwide and helped
                    the band win two Grammy Awards out of six nominations. A year later, Evanescence released their first live album, 
                    Anywhere but Home, which sold more than one million copies worldwide. In 2006, the band released their second studio
                    album, The Open Door, which sold more than five million copies.
                    The lineup of the group changed several times over the course of the first two studio albums' productions and
                    promotions: David Hodges left in 2002, co-founder Moody left in 2003 (mid-tour), bassist Will Boyd in 2006,
                    followed by guitarist John LeCompt and drummer Rocky Gray in 2007, and Terry Balsamo in 2015. As a result,
                    none of the band's three studio albums feature the same lineup. The latter two changes led to a hiatus, with 
                    temporary band members contributing to tour performances.

                    The band reconvened in June 2009 with a new lineup; their next studio album, Evanescence, was released in 2011.
                    It debuted at the top of the Billboard 200 chart with 127,000 copies in sales.The album also debuted at number 
                    on four other different Billboard charts; the Rock Albums, Digital Albums, Alternative Albums, and the Hard Rock 
                    Albums charts. The band spent 2012 on tour in promotion of their latest album with other bands including The Pretty Reckless
                    and Fair to Midland. Troy McLawhorn also became a full-time band member during this time. Following the end of the
                    album's tour cycle in 2012, the band entered another hiatus.
                    In 2015, Evanescence emerged from hiatus and announced they would resume touring; however, they denied that new
                    Evanescence material was being produced, as Lee was focusing on a solo project instead. In addition, Balsamo left 
                    the band and was replaced by Jen Majura. Late 2016 saw additional touring from the band and a statement from Lee
                    that Evanescence would continue. In March 2017, Lee stated Evanescence was working on a fourth album for release 
                    later in 2017. Synthesis was released worldwide on November 10, 2017, and marked a stylistic change in the band's 
                    sound.
